# üì∏ Image Guide for D's Choco Bliss

## How to Add Your Own Product Images

### Method 1: Using Image URLs (Current Setup)

The products are currently using high-quality images from Unsplash. To add your own images:

1. **Upload your images to a hosting service:**
   - **Imgur**: https://imgur.com (free)
   - **Cloudinary**: https://cloudinary.com (free tier)
   - **AWS S3**: For professional hosting
   - **Google Drive**: Make images public and get shareable links

2. **Update the product data:**
   - Edit `backend/data/mockProducts.js`
   - Replace the `image` field with your image URL

   Example:
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: "mock1",
     name: "Pista Kunafa",
     category: "Kunafa Special",
     description: "Delicious kunafa with pistachio filling wrapped in premium chocolate",
     featured: true,
     image: "https://your-image-url.com/pista-kunafa.jpg", // Your image URL
     options: [...]
   }
   ```

### Method 2: Using Local Images (Advanced)

If you want to store images locally in your project:

1. **Create an images folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir frontend/public/images
   mkdir frontend/public/images/products
   ```

2. **Add your images to the folder:**
   ```
   frontend/public/images/products/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pista-kunafa.jpg
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ biscoff-kunafa.jpg
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dark-chocolate-bar.jpg
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ```

3. **Update product data to use local paths:**
   ```javascript
   image: "/images/products/pista-kunafa.jpg"
   ```

4. **Add image upload functionality to admin panel (Future Enhancement)**

### Method 3: Quick Image Replacement

To quickly replace images with your own:

1. **Get your image URLs** (upload to Imgur or similar)
2. **Edit the mock products file:**
   
   Open `backend/data/mockProducts.js` and replace the image URLs:

   ```javascript
   // Replace this line:
   image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606313564200-e75d5e30476c?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80",
   
   // With your image URL:
   image: "https://your-image-url.com/your-image.jpg",
   ```

### Image Requirements

For best results, your images should be:
- **Size**: 500x500 pixels or larger
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Quality**: High resolution, clear and well-lit
- **Style**: Professional product photography
- **Background**: Clean, neutral backgrounds work best

### Example Image URLs for Your Products

Here are some suggested image sources for each product:

**Pista Kunafa**: Look for kunafa or Middle Eastern dessert images
**Biscoff Kunafa**: Search for chocolate-covered desserts
**Dark Chocolate Bar**: Professional chocolate bar photography
**Milk Chocolate Bar**: Classic milk chocolate imagery
**Marvel Double**: Layered chocolate or premium chocolate bars
**Bounty Bar**: Coconut chocolate bars or similar products
**Truffle Chocolate**: Elegant truffle photography
**Nutty Temptation**: Chocolate bars with visible nuts

### Testing Your Images

After updating the image URLs:

1. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit your website**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Check the products page**: http://localhost:3000/products

4. **Verify images load correctly** in both product cards and modal views

### Troubleshooting

**Images not loading?**
- Check if the URL is accessible in your browser
- Ensure the URL doesn't require authentication
- Verify the image format is supported (JPG, PNG, WebP)

**Images look blurry?**
- Use higher resolution images (at least 500x500 pixels)
- Ensure the image URL points to the full-size version

**Images load slowly?**
- Compress your images before uploading
- Use a fast image hosting service
- Consider using WebP format for better compression
